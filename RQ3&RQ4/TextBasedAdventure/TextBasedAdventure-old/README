Right now, I'm developing the code for the game engine.  Everything in the world itself, like the areas and the items, exist solely as contrived situations to test that code as I develop it.  Development of the world itself will come after the engine is working.

The general "architecture" of the code is:
Globals -> Utilities -> Item -> Player -> Menu -> Location -> Locations -> Game

Started on December 5th, 2012.  Very special thanks to Daniel Scanlan, who figured out the cause of a bug that would have killed this project early on had he not caught it.
